    "### Classification by Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 **Structured Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Highly organized data with predefined format stored in tables/databases\n",
    "- **Format:** Follows fixed schema with clear relationships between data points\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Customer records in SQL databases (name, age, email, purchase_history)\n",
    "  - Financial transactions (transaction_id, amount, date, account_id)\n",
    "  - Inventory systems (product_id, quantity, price, location)\n",
    "- **Best Algorithms:** Statistical models, Decision Trees, Linear Regression\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Easy to process\n",
    "  - Requires less preprocessing\n",
    "  - Fits in traditional databases\n",
    "  - Fast to train models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 **Unstructured Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Raw data without predefined format or organization\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Text documents and emails\n",
    "  - Images and videos\n",
    "  - Audio files\n",
    "  - Social media posts\n",
    "- **Best Algorithms:** Deep Learning (CNNs for images, RNNs for text, autoencoders)\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Requires significant preprocessing\n",
    "  - Needs feature extraction\n",
    "  - Large storage requirements\n",
    "  - High computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 **Semi-Structured Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Data with some organizational structure but not fully formatted\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - JSON and XML files\n",
    "  - Log files with timestamps\n",
    "  - Email metadata\n",
    "  - Web pages with HTML tags\n",
    "- **Processing:** Hybrid approach combining structured and unstructured techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification by Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 **Numerical (Quantitative) Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Data represented as numbers and measured on a scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Numerical Data:**\n",
    "- Countable, takes specific integer values only\n",
    "- Examples: number of students (5, 10, 100), count of items, frequency\n",
    "- Range: Finite set of values\n",
    "- Used in: Classification problems, counting tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Numerical Data:**\n",
    "- Can take any value within a range\n",
    "- Examples: temperature (25.3\u00b0C, 25.4\u00b0C), weight (65.2 kg), height, salary\n",
    "- Range: Infinite possibilities\n",
    "- Used in: Regression problems, predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 **Categorical (Qualitative) Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Data that represents categories or labels, not measurable on a numerical scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nominal Data (No Order):**\n",
    "- Categories without inherent ranking\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary\n",
    "  - Color: Red, Blue, Green\n",
    "  - Car brands: Toyota, Ford, BMW\n",
    "  - Department: HR, Engineering, Sales\n",
    "- Characteristic: Order doesn't matter\n",
    "- Encoding Required: One-hot encoding (creates binary columns for each category)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Data (With Order):**\n",
    "- Categories with meaningful ranking or order\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Education level: High School < Bachelor's < Master's < Ph.D.\n",
    "  - Customer satisfaction: Poor < Average < Good < Excellent\n",
    "  - Clothing sizes: XS < S < M < L < XL\n",
    "  - Movie ratings: 1 star < 2 stars < 3 stars < 5 stars\n",
    "- Characteristic: Order has significance\n",
    "- Encoding: Label encoding (preserves order: 1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification by Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 **Labeled Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Data with predefined output/target labels\n",
    "- **Structure:** (Features, Label) pairs\n",
    "- **Usage:** Supervised Learning\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Email: \"Buy now, limited offer\"  \u2192  Label: SPAM\n",
    "  Email: \"Project update attached\"  \u2192  Label: NOT_SPAM\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Requirement:** Expensive and time-consuming to create\n",
    "- **Applications:** Email filtering, disease diagnosis, house price prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7 **Unlabeled Data**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Data with only input features, no target output\n",
    "- **Structure:** Only features, no labels\n",
    "- **Usage:** Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Customer: [Age: 28, Income: 50000, Purchases: [electronics, books, clothes]]\n",
    "  \u2192 No label, discover patterns yourself\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Availability:** More abundant and cheaper\n",
    "- **Applications:** Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, pattern discovery"
