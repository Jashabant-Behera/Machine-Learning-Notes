    "## Phase 1: Framing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Problem Framing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem framing is the most critical phase. A well-defined problem leads to success; a poorly-defined problem leads to wasted resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components to Define\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Business Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate objective the organization wants to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Reduce customer churn rate from 15% to 10% within 6 months\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Not: \"Build a churn prediction model\"\n",
    "But: \"Identify customers likely to churn so we can offer retention incentives, \n",
    "      reducing churn by 5% and saving $2M annually\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Problem Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classify the ML problem into one of these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predicting a categorical label\n",
    "  - Binary: Fraud/Not Fraud, Churn/No Churn\n",
    "  - Multi-class: Product Category A/B/C, Risk Level (Low/Medium/High)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicting continuous numeric values\n",
    "  - House prices, stock prices, demand forecast\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Ranking/Recommendation**: Ordering items by relevance\n",
    "  - Product recommendations, search ranking\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Clustering**: Grouping similar items\n",
    "  - Customer segmentation, anomaly detection\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Time Series**: Predicting future values based on temporal patterns\n",
    "  - Stock price forecasting, energy demand prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Churn prediction is a Classification problem (Binary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Success Metrics (Business & Technical)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Business metrics measure impact on organization:\n",
    "- Revenue increase, cost reduction, customer retention\n",
    "- Customer satisfaction, risk reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical metrics measure model performance:\n",
    "- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC\n",
    "- Regression: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R\u00b2\n",
    "- Ranking: NDCG, MAP (Mean Average Precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example for Churn Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Metric: \n",
    "- Reduce churn by 5% = $2M annual savings\n",
    "- Cost per false positive (incorrect prediction): $50 (wrong incentive sent)\n",
    "- Cost per false negative (missed churn): $500 (lost customer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Metric:\n",
    "- Precision >= 80% (don't waste incentives on non-churners)\n",
    "- Recall >= 70% (catch most actual churners)\n",
    "- Minimum F1 score: 0.75\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Constraints & Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Latency**: How fast must predictions be made?\n",
    "  - Real-time (< 100ms): Fraud detection, autonomous vehicles\n",
    "  - Batch (daily/weekly): Demand forecasting, campaign targeting\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Must we explain why the model made a prediction?\n",
    "  - High need: Healthcare, finance, legal (regulatory compliance)\n",
    "  - Low need: Recommendation systems, content ranking\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scale**: How many predictions per day?\n",
    "  - Millions/billions: Social media, finance\n",
    "  - Thousands: Internal business use\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data availability**: How much quality data do we have?\n",
    "  - Rich data: Easy\n",
    "  - Limited labeled data: Need semi-supervised or transfer learning\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Fairness/Bias**: Are there protected attributes we must avoid?\n",
    "  - Example: Credit scoring cannot discriminate by race/gender\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example Problem Frame (Complete):\n",
    "\n",
    "Project: Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Goal:\n",
    "- Identify customers likely to churn in next 30 days\n",
    "- Enable retention team to target with personalized offers\n",
    "- Target: Reduce churn from 15% to 10%, save $2M annually\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Type: Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Metrics:\n",
    "- Technical: Precision >= 80%, Recall >= 70%, F1 >= 0.75, ROC-AUC >= 0.85\n",
    "- Business: 5% absolute churn reduction, $2M cost savings, positive ROI\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Latency: Batch processing (daily/weekly acceptable)\n",
    "- Interpretability: Medium (explain key drivers, no need for perfect explainability)\n",
    "- Scale: 10M customers, 1M predictions per run\n",
    "- Data: 2 years of transaction data, ~50K historical churners\n",
    "- Fairness: Avoid bias by customer demographics\n",
